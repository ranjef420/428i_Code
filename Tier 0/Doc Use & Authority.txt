DOCUMENT REFERENCE & HIERARCHY OF AUTHORITY

1. Doc Use & Authority.txt

PURPOSE:
Master reference file defining the hierarchy of authority, usage protocols, and guardrails for all other project documents.  
- Authority Role: Governs how Tier 1–6 documents are to be used.  
- Guardrail: It never replaces technical content within Tier 1–6. Instead, it dictates usage sequence, verification rules, and safety directives.  
- Placement: Sits above Tier 1 as the meta-instruction layer; all other documents derive their priority and handling rules from it.

CORE DOCUMENT USAGE PROTOCOL & GUARDRAILS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Always follow the document hierarchy: Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3 → Tier 4 → Tier 5 → Tier 6.
    - Tier 1 OEM manuals define baseline operation and safety; cross-check before all coding.  
    - Tier 2 E-Sys & F-Series coding tools are the primary coding authority after Tier 1 validation.  
    - Tier 3 BimmerCode docs serve as a fallback resource if E-Sys is unavailable or impractical.  
    - Tier 4 aftermarket equipment and focused component specs must be considered where integration applies.  
    - Tier 5 supplementary resources provide secondary reference material but never override higher tiers.  
    - Tier 6 archived/low-utility material is retained for completeness but should not guide coding decisions.  

BMW 428i Owners Manual.pdf: 
- Defines baseline vehicle behavior, safety procedures, and default system settings.
