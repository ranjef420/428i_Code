DOCUMENT REFERENCE & HIERARCHY OF AUTHORITY

1. Doc Use & Authority.txt

PURPOSE:
Master reference file defining the hierarchy of authority, usage protocols, and guardrails for all other project documents.  
- Authority Role: Governs how Tier 1–6 documents are to be used.  
- Guardrail: It never replaces technical content within Tier 1–6. Instead, it dictates usage sequence, verification rules, and safety directives.  
- Placement: Sits above Tier 1 as the meta-instruction layer; all other documents derive their priority and handling rules from it.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CORE DOCUMENT USAGE PROTOCOL & GUARDRAILS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Always follow the document hierarchy: Tier 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6.  
    - Tier 1 OEM manuals define baseline operation and safety; cross-check before all coding.  
    - Tier 2 E-Sys & F-Series coding tools are the primary coding authority after Tier 1 validation.  
    - Tier 3 BimmerCode docs serve as a fallback resource if E-Sys is unavailable or impractical.  
    - Tier 4 aftermarket equipment and focused component specs must be considered where integration applies.  
    - Tier 5 supplementary resources provide secondary reference material but never override higher tiers.  
    - Tier 6 archived/low-utility material is retained for completeness but should not guide coding decisions.  

BMW 428i Owners Manual.pdf: 
- Defines baseline vehicle behavior, safety procedures, and default system settings.  
- Guardrails: Treat as the highest authority for operational norms. No coding guidance may contradict the manual's specifications.

BMW 428i VIN Specs.txt:
- Confirms exact equipment present in the coded vehicle (VIN options, hardware modules, installed features).  
- Guardrails: Must be checked before suggesting coding. Do not recommend features not supported by installed equipment.

BMW 428i Nav & Comm Manual.pdf:
- Covers OEM multimedia and NBT behavior, UI logic, supported media formats, and device compatibility.  
- Guardrails: Always reference before coding headunit-related changes. Prevents misconfiguration of unsupported media paths or formats.

BMW 428i Engine Manual.pdf:
- Defines the N20 engine's electronic control parameters, DME coding implications, and diagnostic procedures.  
- Guardrails: Required reference for any engine or performance-related coding. Do not override or extrapolate values without confirmation from this manual.

BMW 428i RealOEM Map.txt: 
- RealOEM is OEM; the map is assistant-authored guidance. 
- Use interactively with user confirmation at each step. 
- Guardrails:
    - Do not crawl RealOEM. VIN requests only if last-7 is strictly needed and user consents.

BimmerCode QuickStart.txt:
- Provides setup workflow, Bluetooth connection, recovery instructions, and automatic backup usage.  
- Guardrails: All connection and recovery steps must be explained using this as the authority. Never improvise procedures outside this guide.

BimmerCode F32-Code Options.txt:
- Defines supported coding options, required control units, and allowed values for the F32 platform.  
- Guardrails: Treat as definitive for available BimmerCode features. Do not recommend options absent from this file unless formally verified elsewhere.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
AFTERMARKET, COMMUNITY, & SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL USAGE PROTOCOLS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

BMW 428i Headunit Retrofit.pdf:
- Full aftermarket integration notes integrating CarPlay, front/rear view camera functionality, audio routing, AUX/USB/BT troubleshooting, and OEM System settings.

BMW 428i Suppl Info.pdf:
- Provides supplemental BMW-issued compatibility notes, warranty references, and technical specs such as tire pressure.  
- Guardrails: Use only to supplement Tier 1 manuals. Never substitute for OEM Owner's Manual guidance; consult when warranty or compatibility constraints arise.

BMW 428i Owners Quickref.pdf:
- Quick reference and emergency operation manual. Summarizes essential owner's manual procedures.  
- Guardrails: Use only for fast checks or emergency features. Always confirm details in the full Owner's Manual.

- Use its decision tree to triage issues.
- Grades A–B indicate reliability for surfacing references.
- Guardrails:
    - Consult only after Tier 1–3. Always treat as community-sourced.
