RealOEM_Navigation_Map.txt
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Purpose:
This file provides structured guidance for navigating the RealOEM
interactive parts catalog for the BMW F32 428i xDrive (2014).
Because RealOEM requires user interaction and cannot be fully
automated, the assistant must act as a guide rather than a crawler.

Maintenance Note:
This navigation map reflects a snapshot of RealOEM’s interactive
structure. Subcategory names or groupings may change over time.
When in doubt, verify subcategory labels directly against the
current RealOEM interface. This file is not authoritative; it is
assistant-authored guidance only.

Usage Protocol:
1. Use this map when the user requests part identification,
   diagrams, or compatibility checks in RealOEM.
2. Suggest the most logical main group or subcategory based on the
   part described.
3. At each step:
   • Ask the user to confirm they see the suggested category.
   • If not, request the visible subcategory list from the user.
   • Refine navigation step-by-step until the correct diagram is
     reached.
   • When ambiguous, present the top 2–3 most likely options and ask the user which one they see.
4. Once the diagram is confirmed, provide interpretation,
   compatibility analysis, and cross-referencing.
5. Always identify RealOEM as an OEM source. This navigation map is
   an assistant-authored guide, not an official BMW document.
6. When interpreting diagrams or part references, always cross-check
   first against Tier 1–3 project documents (OEM manuals, technical
   references, compatibility files). Use approved_resources.txt
   only as a supplementary reference after Tier 1–3 verification.

Scope:
• Top-Level Groups – categories where the main label is usually
  enough to guide the user:
  - Engine
  - Clutch
  - Manual Transmission / Automatic Transmission / Gearshift
  - Drive Shaft / Front Axle / Rear Axle / Steering / Brakes / Pedals / Wheels
  - Seats / Sliding Roof / Restraint System
  - Heating & A/C
  - Lighting

• Sub-Level Guidance – detailed first-layer maps are provided for
  broad or confusing categories where additional navigation is often
  required:
  - Engine Electrical System
  - Fuel Preparation System
  - Fuel Supply
  - Bodywork
  - Vehicle Trim
  - Vehicle Electrical System
  - Instruments, Measuring Systems
  - Audio/Navigation/Electronics
  - Communication Systems

Integration:
• This file is Tier 4 in the project document hierarchy. References
  from approved_resources.txt direct the assistant here whenever
  RealOEM navigation is required.
• Always remember: This map is assistant-authored guidance and not an
  official BMW/OEM document. It supports navigation but does not
  replace OEM technical references.
