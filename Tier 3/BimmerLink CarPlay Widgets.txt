# BimmerLink CarPlay Widgets.txt

### Overview
This document defines optimized sensor selections for real-time CarPlay widget display. The focus is on performance feedback, engine protection, and situational awareness. Parameters are specifically tailored for the N20 turbocharged engine’s critical monitoring requirements.

### Implementation

Widget Layout Priorities
- Primary Display: Oil pressure, coolant temperature, boost pressure, vehicle speed  
- Secondary Display: G-forces, transmission temperature, battery voltage, wastegate position  
- Tertiary Display: Misfire counters, knock detection, pump speeds, fan operation  

N20 Turbo-Specific Considerations
- Boost pressure and wastegate position are essential for turbocharger health  
- Oil pressure and temperature require continuous monitoring, especially under load  
- Knock detection provides immediate feedback for detonation events  
- Cooling system data helps prevent overheating damage to turbo components
