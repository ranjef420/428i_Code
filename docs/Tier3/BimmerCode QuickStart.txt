### Connection ###

Please follow the instructions listed here in order to prevent external interference during coding and avoid problems.
Preparing your car

    Turn on the ignition in the car. For G-Series cars the diagnostic mode has to be activated additionally (press the start button in the car three times in quick succession without pushing the brake or clutch pedal).
    
    Please make sure that the engine is not running.
    
    Ensure that no gear is engaged (selector lever position P for cars with automatic transmission) and that the parking brake is on.
    
    Make sure all electrical consumers (lights, heating, ventilation etc.) are turned off.
    
    Disconnect or disable any third party hardware installed to the car that is connected to the CAN bus (e.g. JB4, rear view camera, exhaust flap control), because the communication may be interfered and coding may fail in this case.
    
    The headunit has to be in its original state. If you used a third party solution to enable CarPlay or the navigation has been unlocked, these changes have to be reverted, because BimmerCode will not allow coding the headunit otherwise. Retrofitted iDrive systems may also not be accessible under certain circumstances.

- iOS

    Connect with Bluetooth adapter (Adapter utilized: Veepeak OBDCheck BLE+ Bluetooth)

- How to connect

    Please make sure to force quit any other app running in the background that may be using the OBD adapter (OBDLink app for example).
    
    Plug in the adapter into the OBD port in the footwell on the driver side in the car.
    
    Enable the Airplane mode on the iOS device.
    
    Turn on Bluetooth on the iOS device.
    
    For OBDLink MX+ users: This adapter has to be paired with the iOS device as described here.
    
    Turn off Wi-Fi on the iOS device.
    
    Disable CarPlay in the iOS settings (“Settings” > “General” > “CarPlay” > Select car > Disable “CarPlay”).
    
    Disconnect the iOS device in the iDrive settings in the car (“COM” > “Mobile devices” > Select the device > “Disconnect device”).
    
    Disconnect any additional Bluetooth connections to other devices.
    
    Keep the distance between the iOS device and the adapter as short as possible.
    
    Open the settings in the BimmerCode app and make sure the correct adapter type is selected.
    
    Tap “Connect” on the start screen in the BimmerCode app.
    
    Allow BimmerCode to use Bluetooth when prompted in the app.

- Troubleshooting

    Make sure you have allowed BimmerCode access to Bluetooth (iOS Settings > BimmerCode > Bluetooth)
    
    Make sure to follow the steps outlined in “Preparing your car” and “How to connect”.
    
    Remove the OBD adapter from the OBD port, plug it in again firmly and make sure that the LEDs in the adapter are lighting up. If the LEDs in the adapter do not light up when connected, the adapter may be faulty or there may be an electrical problem with the OBD port in your car (a bent pin for example).
    
    Make sure that your OBD adapter is supported for iOS devices. There are some variants that can only be used for Android and do not work for iOS. You can check the compatibility here.
    
    Make sure that your OBD is supported for your specific car. You can check compatibility here.
    
    Restart your device and the OBD adapter by unplugging it.
    If you have some kind of third party CarPlay unit connected to the iDrive system in your car, please enable “Ignore headunit” in the settings in the app. If you want to access the headunit with BimmerCode you have to disconnect the CarPlay unit from the iDrive system temporarily.
    
    For OBDLink adapter users: Update the adapter firmware using the OBDLink app and make sure that the OBDLink app is not running in the background when trying to connect with BimmerCode.


### Coding ###

There are two different ways to code your car: The basic mode allows you to code the most popular coding options in an easy and convenient way and the expert mode is intended for experienced users that are already familiar with coding and have special knowledge. In general expert mode is not required and all popular options are available in the basic mode.

- Coding in basic mode

    Connect to the car as described in the chapter ”Connecting”.
    
    Select the type of your car from the displayed list and tap ”Connect”
    
    The control units in the car are identified now and a list of all supported control units is displayed afterwards.
    
    Select a control unit from the list.
    
    Make the desired changes for the selected control unit. You can find a list of the supported coding options for your car here.
    
    Tap ”Code” to start the coding process.
    
    The coding process will start and a message will be displayed on success.

- Coding in expert mode (WARNING: Using expert mode incorrectly can cause serious problems in the car. This feature is intended for experienced users with special knowledge only and the use is at your own risk.)

    Connect to the car as described in the chapter ”Connecting”.
    
    Select a control unit from the list.
    
    Activate expert mode by selection ”Expert mode”.
    
    Make the desired changes for the selected control unit.
    
    Tap ”Code” to start the coding process.

- After coding

    After coding the car may display errors, but there is no need to worry. This is totally normal and the errors will disappear after a short period of time when you turn the ignition off and on again.
    
    Depending on the control unit you may have to set the time again and restore user defined settings in the iDrive system in the car.
    
    When coding the instrument cluster the average consumption is reset and the remaining range may display an unusual value. This will normalize itself after some driving cycles.
    
    After coding the instrument cluster the outside temperature may display an unusual value. This will normalize itself after some time.

- Coding failure

If an error occurs during coding, please proceed as follows:

    Close the connection, restart the iOS or Android device and the adapter (disconnect and reconnect).
    
    Open BimmerCode and connect as described in the chapter ”Connecting”. Please exactly follow these instructions in order to prevent external interference during coding and avoid problems.
    
    Select the specific control unit. If coding data is invalid this is marked with a red dot.
    
    Restore the coding data using a backup as described in the chapter ”Backups”.
    
    If coding fails continuously, please contact support using the “Support request” option in the settings in the app.

Backups and recovery

- iOS

Each time a control unit is read out, a backup of the coding data for the selected control unit is automatically saved for later restoration of the original data or for restoration in the event of an error.
Recovery

    Connect to the car as described in the chapter ”Connecting”.
    
    Select a control unit from the list.
    
    Tap ”Backups”.
    
    Select a backup from the list (the backups are sorted ascending by creation date). To undo all coding in the selected control unit, please select the last backup at the bottom of the list.
    
    Tap ”Done”.
    
    Tap ”Start coding” to start the coding process.

- Exporting backups

In order to have access to the backups even if the iOS device is changed or lost, it should be backed up regularly. The backups can be transferred to a Windows or Mac computer as described here . The backups are also accessible via the iOS Files app (open the Files app > ”On My iPhone”> ”BimmerCode” > ”Backups”) and can therefore also be saved in iCloud Drive, for example.
The backups will be lost if you delete the app from your device, so please make sure to export and save them before.

- FAQ: 

Q: Should the engine be running during coding?
A: It is recommended to code with the engine off and ignition turned on.

Q: Why are there errors displayed in the car after coding?
A: After coding the specific control unit is reset and therefore not reachable for the other control units in the car for a short amount of time. This results in errors displayed in the car, but these errors will disappear after turning the ignition off and on again.

Q: Is it possible to “brick” an control unit?
A: No. Even when the connection is interrupted during coding or an error occurs, the coding data can be restored using a backup and then the control unit will operate completely normal again, but please note that using expert mode incorrectly can cause problems that may require a reflash of the control unit to correct them.

Q: What should I do if an error occurs during coding?
A: In this case please unplug the adapter, restart your iOS or Android device and then connect again. Make sure flight mode is enabled and all Bluetooth connections (for streaming music for example) including the connection to the iDrive system are disconnected. It may also be necessary to restore the coding data using a backup.

Q: Why is it not possible to change the duration of the one-touch turn signal?
A: The possibility to change the duration of the one-touch turn signal has been removed from the software in the car by BMW and it is no longer possible to change this.

Q: Why is expert mode not available for all control units?
A: For your own safety, expert mode is not available for control units that contain safety related functions.

Q: The control units and coding options displayed in demo mode are different to what is available when I connect to my car. Why?
A: In demo mode no connection is established and the displayed control units and options do not reflect what is possible for your car. You can find a list of the available options for your car are here.

Q: BimmerCode displays a critical error for the FRM in my car and does not allow coding it. What is wrong?
A: Some FRMs are affected by an error that leads to a corrupted boot sector in the internal memory of the control unit after some years of usage. This is not noticeable during normal operation, but if the control unit has to be restarted after the battery has been replaced or to make coding changes take effect, the control unit will not be able to start again and needs to be replaced or repaired. BimmerCode is able to detect this error prematurely and does not allow coding the FRM in your car in this case.


Q: What is the difference between BimmerCode and BimmerLink?
A: BimmerCode and BimmerLink are two different applications designed for BMW and Mini vehicles, aimed at enhancing and customizing the user experience. Both apps are developed by the SG Software GmbH & Co. KG but serve distinct purposes:

    BimmerCode is an app designed for coding and customizing the electronic control units (ECUs) in BMW and Mini vehicles. With BimmerCode, users can unlock hidden features and customize their vehicle's settings to suit their preferences. For example, users can enable features like video playback while driving, change the way the car's lights behave, or enable options that were not available in their region or model. BimmerCode provides an easy-to-use interface, making it simple for users with little or no coding experience to modify their vehicle's settings.
    
    BimmerLink is an app designed for monitoring and diagnostic purposes. It enables users to access and read data from their vehicle's ECUs, providing valuable information about the vehicle's performance and health. BimmerLink allows users to read and clear error codes, monitor real-time sensor data, and perform various diagnostic tests. This app is particularly useful for users who want to keep an eye on their vehicle's performance, troubleshoot issues, or monitor data while performing modifications. In summary, BimmerCode focuses on coding and customization, while BimmerLink focuses on monitoring and diagnostics. Both apps can be used independently or in conjunction with one another, depending on the user's needs and preferences.
